# DO MATH! STAY SHARP!

This repo is just exercises that I do to keep myself sharp.

When I used to do math before graduating, it felt good to produce a
stack of papers with the exercises. It's nice to just have this pile
to look at and feel satisfied at the end of the day. This is a
digital equivalent.
